# SemiRelevantPunBot

##Heavily WIP

Looks at images from imgur and, using 3rd party services, tries to discern the context and then posts a hopefully relevant pun as a comment.

##TODO
- Fix the problem with Imgur.API returning the same albums over and over
- Different weights for the tags, descending
- Allow more than 1 image
- Look at album tags
- Actually post comments
- Refactor and clean up
- Proper logging
- Optimize
- MORE PUNS
